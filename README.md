# Supply-Chain-Insight
### **Project Objective**  
The objective of this project is to analyze supply chain performance using key metrics such as In-Full Percentage (IF%), On-Time Percentage (OT%), and On-Time In-Full Percentage (OTIF%) using a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to identify areas for improvement in supply chain efficiency, customer order fulfillment, and logistics performance.

### **Insights**  
1. **Overall Performance**:  
   - **Average In-Full Target**: **76.51%**  
   - **Average On-Time Target**: **86.09%**  
   - **Average OTIF Target**: **65.91%**  
   - **Actual Performance Metrics**:  
     - **IF% (In-Full Rate)**: **52.78%** (lower than the target)  
     - **OT% (On-Time Rate)**: **59.03%** (lower than the target)  
     - **OTIF% (On-Time In-Full Rate)**: **29.02%** (significantly below target)  

2. **Performance by Region**:  
   - **Ahmedabad**: OTIF% at **66.5%** vs. target **29.3%**  
   - **Surat**: OTIF% at **66.4%** vs. target **30.1%**  
   - **Vadodara**: OTIF% at **64.9%** vs. target **27.8%**  
   - On-time percentage is highest in **Surat (86.3%)**, followed by **Vadodara (86.2%)** and **Ahmedabad (85.8%)**.  

3. **Customer Order Performance**:  
   - **Best-performing stores** (High OTIF%): Propel Mart (40.92%), Atlas Stores (39.55%), Expert Mart (39.11%).  
   - **Lowest OTIF% stores**: Coolblue (13.75%), Acclaimed Stores (15.47%), Lotus Mart (16.34%).  
   - Major discrepancies exist in on-time vs. in-full deliveries, impacting overall OTIF%.  

4. **Product Performance**:  
   - **High-demand products**: AM Biscuits 750K, AM Milk 500K, AM Ghee 150K.  
   - **Order fulfillment issues**: Several products show lower LIFR% and high ADDD (Average Days Delayed in Delivery).  

### **Conclusion**  
The supply chain is underperforming in key areas, with **OTIF% significantly below target (29.02%)**. Both **In-Full (IF%) and On-Time (OT%) performance require improvement**, particularly in key regions. Certain stores and products contribute to delivery inefficiencies, requiring strategic interventions like better demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization. Enhancing supply chain efficiency will improve customer satisfaction and reduce order fulfillment delays.
